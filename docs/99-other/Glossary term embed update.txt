Questions
---------
- Should there be interaction between Vocabulary and the glossification function?
    - Suggest: Not specifically. It would provide a strong implementation dependency (to insert glossary in the model)
    - Better: Parse glossified fields and add vocabulary at save time
        - Would be only additive: You can have words in the glossary that aren't glossified. All deletions must be manual.
