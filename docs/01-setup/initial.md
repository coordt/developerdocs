## Get Access to the Repos

Before you can do anything, you will need access to the code repositories on GitHub and the individual servers. You need to send the lead developer or project manager an email requesting access and include your GitHub account name and your SSH public key.

- If you don't have a GitHub account, [sign up][sign up].
- If you don't have git installed, [install homebrew][install-homebrew] and then [install git][install-git].
- If you don't know if you have a SSH public key, [look for one][look for one].
- If you don't have a SSH public key, [create an SSH key pair][create an SSH key pair].
