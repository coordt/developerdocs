# Search

## How Search is Used

Our search index is used whenever we need to search across multiple models or content types. Currently we use it for:

- Topic pages or Dynamic Collections
- Index pages
- General Search
- Specialized Search

### Topic pages

Also called dynamic collections, these are generated by searching our content
based on one or more tags/keywords/concepts.

### Index pages

An index page is any page where we want to list everything that has attribute "x." Typically each type of content (e.g. Article, Event, Profile) has an index page, but the implementation is generic enough to allow any attribute.

The only limitation is one of URL handling so things don't get too confusing.

### General search

This is the general search across the entire site.

### Specialized search

This is a search implementation that provides extra capabilities, for example filtering on a specific set of attributes.

"Education Search" is an example of specialized search, in that it allows filtering by school grades and ages.


## Search Implementation

### Query Modification

- Use both the exact search query and the tokenized pieces of the query
- An exact match of the search query gets boosted above matches of the tokenized pieces
- Matches in the title get a boost
- Matches in the content_type get a boost
